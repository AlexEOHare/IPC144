1.findCOntactIndex is useful as it allows you to call the function to find the poition of a specific number in the array. This essentially allows you to find a person by phone number and speeds up calling on a specific contact. getTenDigitPhone is great as it works hand in hand with fondContactIndex at times allowing you to ask for a phone number while at the same time checking to make sure the input meets the specifications of the program. This is extremely useful as it helps us to continue working with numbers and values we are expecting to handle.
2.Assignment 2 was great for changing my way of thinking and showing me how useful creating a function to do a specific task and then calling on that function every time that task needs to be completed.
